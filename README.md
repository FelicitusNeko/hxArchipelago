# hxArchipelago

Haxe Archipelago multiworld randomizer client library. See [archipelago.gg](https://archipelago.gg).

This is a port of [apclientpp](https://github.com/black-sliver/apclientpp) by Black-Sliver.

## How to use

Just install the package via `haxelib`, then `import ap.Client` into your project, and you should be good to go. This project aims to be as functionally identical to apclientpp as possible, although some operative differences may occur as a result of using Haxe syntax and language features.
